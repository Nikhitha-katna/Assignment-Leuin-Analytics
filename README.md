## I have designed  a sample layout to structure web page like how should it look etc.
## Then i have decided to create files including index.html - for home page,details.html-for explore page ,css file for styling and js file for functionality.(script.js-for homePage functionality and scripts.html for explore page functionality)
 ## I have used HTML for structure, CSS for styling and JavaScript for functionality.
## I have used semantic HTML elements to structure the webPage
## Then I used CSS to style the webPage
## For the backgrond color i used golden color with combination of Black and white as golden and black combo resides the color of autos and the white color resides the color of cabs in India
## I have used Flex layout to display cards 
## For the website appear visually appealing i have used hover effects 
## I have used JavaScript to add functionality to the webPage
